.Sh HISTORY
clu is the 4th or 5th incarnation of this idea. I finally gave up on 2 different incarnations of shell script -
bash AND fish. The deployment is easy(er) but the programming is AWFUL. Python it is. (I wish Python had the same deployment model of Go...)
The original was call "whatami", as opposed to "whoami" for users. Its also been called
.Qq hwid
,
.Qq kgb
, and
.Qq gru
\&.
The russian spy theme became inappropriate, so I settled on
.Nm\&.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Hunter Matthews Aq hunter@unix.haus

.Sh BUGS
I'm sure there are many.
